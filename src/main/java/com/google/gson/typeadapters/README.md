# type adapters

This module directly copy from google's gson extras package since it didn't publish as a library can be import by Gradle. However, it provides `RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory` which can handle heterogeneous list. Therefore, I directly copy this peace of code to here, but remember the LICENSE still should follow gson's LICENSE, not MIT LICENSE(which intellij-racket use).
